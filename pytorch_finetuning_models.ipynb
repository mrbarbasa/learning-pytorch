In finetuning, we start with a pretrained model and update all of the modelâ€™s parameters for our new task, in essence retraining the whole model. In feature extraction, we start with a pretrained model and only update the final layer weights from which we derive predictions. It is called feature extraction because we use the pretrained CNN as a fixed feature-extractor, and only change the output layer.\n",
